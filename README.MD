# UAS-DTU Simulation Submission
The following files are our submission for the ICUAS'2023 Simulation round.
It consists of your original package which has been modified by us according to your needs. We have modified the `session.yaml`and the Dockerfile, so that it builds and installs all the dependencies. The given `start.sh` can be used to launch the simulation.

The *custom_packages* folder contains the packages that were heavily modified by us to be used in this simulation. These packages must be placed in the *uav_ws/src* folder, and `catkin b` be used to build the packages.
